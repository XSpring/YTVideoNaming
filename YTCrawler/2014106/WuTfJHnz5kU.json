{"key":"WuTfJHnz5kU","title":"Assassin’s Creed Unity New Cinematic Trailer | Arno Master Assassin (2014) 【Movie Scene HD】","description":"Assassin's Creed Unity trailer introduces new character, presents CGI stabbings, \"Watch Arno in this new cinematic trailer,\" suggests the trailer's description, \"while he is in race against the clock to save a Templar! Who is she? How would our new Master Assassin manage his cornelian dilemma?\" Another question: is her reveal a response to the controversy and mixed messages surrounding ACU's lack of women as playable characters? And are you really going with \"fiery\"? Other than Elise, there's not too much to be learned: it's a pretty unrepresentative—and unrepresentatively pretty—slice of the game's world. Assassin's Creed Unity is an upcoming historical action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is set to release worldwide on October 28, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Set within Paris during the French Revolution, the single-player story follows Arno Dorian in his efforts to expose the true powers behind the Revolution. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as familiar melee combat and stealth system. Assassin's Creed Unity introduces cooperative multiplayer to the Assassin's Creed series, letting up to four players explore and engage in narrative-driven missions. ➚Subscribe to CG: http://bitly.com/CommunityGame Subscribe now to get the latest gameplay trailers, game teasers, game trailers, videogame walkthrough, cinematic video, top 10, and all cutscenes compilation of video game scenes! 2014 / 2015: http://bitly.com/CommunityGame ➚Like CommunityGame On Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/CommunityGameHQ ➚+ CommunityGame On Google Plus https://plus.google.com/+CommunityGame/ ➚Visit our Community Games Website: http://www.CommunityGameHQ.com/ ➚For More Community Gameplays, Video Games, MMO, Rpg.
