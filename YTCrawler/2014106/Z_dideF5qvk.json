But when Alexander tells his upbeat family about the misadventures of his disastrous day, he finds little sympathy and begins to wonder if bad things only happen to him. He soon learns that he's not alone when his mom (Jennifer Garner), dad (Steve Carell), brother (Dylan Minnette) and sister (Kerris Dorsey) all find themselves living through their own terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. Anyone who says there is no such thing as a bad day just hasn't had one. \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,\" directed by Independent Spirit Award-winner Miguel Arteta (\"The Good Girl,\" \"Cedar Rapids,\" \"Youth in Revolt\") from a screenplay by Rob Lieber, is a 21 Laps Entertainment/Jim Henson Company production. \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" alexander terrible horrible \"no good\" \"bad day\" \"Steve Carell\" \"Jennifer Garner\" \"Burn Gorman\" \"Bella Thorne\" \"Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day trailer\" \"Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day movie\" kangaroo misadventures vchan","publishedDate":"Published on May 8, 2014","viewCount":1848896,"noOfLikes":6705,"noOfDislikes":504,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=ljqMe9RFJN0","/watch?v=rTmvY11m_0E","/watch?v=laLoeVDX_0A","/watch?v=Be7uSIjFCa0","/watch?v=uMtNpu6xBvU","/watch?v=KY5Ug1OW5O4","/watch?v=Rf222d4NGlI","/watch?v=1mC0UMihQg0","/watch?v=rC17twr50WU","/watch?v=jAI7rF0eQyQ","/watch?v=LqE32n-K7Qg","/watch?v=mq1rt4iKuYg","/watch?v=8Yih-CxTWsw","/watch?v=M29yK7WWeKY","/watch?v=N8d6Bpl2eAo","/watch?v=KG5CnCgnplU","/watch?v=VW4XO-52ubE","/watch?v=wJj0lRUbpQQ","/watch?v=7o28JLTalNM","/watch?v=B8s_1UcdoNI"],"category":"","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT2M29S","channelID":"UCi8e0iOVk1fEOogdfu4YgfA","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/movieclipsTRAILERS","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/101414284810039277897","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
