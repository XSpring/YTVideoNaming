{"key":"QHXxJtouJsQ","title":"Gorlex's Best of Epic Orchestra Music Compilations","description":"A glorious recap of the past 6 months worth of my uploads. Presented in a \"Mix style\" instead of a compilation, which is why the upload is about a week later then usual. Out of the 128 songs I've uploaded in my Compilations, I was able to use 34 (with my limited ability to mix) and have it sound presentable. This is my first time attempting to mix orchestra music, so I hope you guys enjoy it :) Note: Some songs may be edited in terms of length or in some form for transitioning/mixing purposes, and thus may not be in their full form.
