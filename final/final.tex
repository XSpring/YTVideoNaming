\begin{abstract}
	In this work we address the problem of ranking two objects given their features. The problem is applied to a context of guessing the more popular one out of two given YouTube videos. We formulate this problem into two different approaches, namely, binary classification and linear regression. Experiments are conducted in our data set crawled from YouTube for one month. Results show that both approaches yields a slightly above 50\% accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
	YouTube is one of the most popular video-sharing online platform in the Internet. It attracts billion of unique user visit monthly and has diverse topics in their video content. YouTube users can earn money from the number of views of their uploaded videos. Hence, understanding the secrets of making a popular YouTube video is essential for people who want to make benefits from the site. There are many factors to determine popularity of a video, but in general we can pin down to have the following two: having good content and good marketing plan. One of the techniques to attract more viewerships is to make the video's "visual appearance" look appealing via catchy keywords, informative cover picture, etc.

	The ranking problem (aka. Learning to rank\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning\_to\_rank}) is a typical supervised learning problem of predicting the rank of a set of items regarding to a set of criteria. It has a numerous applications in a broad domains such as web search, multimedia retrieval, recommender systems, etc. Results from such problems can bring benefits to Internet users, such as saving their time by introducing the most relevant products/articles/web pages to their interests. In YouTube context, ranking problems can be raised to recommend most relevant videos to a given video. Another application is to predict the ranking of videos regarding to their popularity.

	\textbf{Problem statement.} Given a set of videos, each is associated with a set of bag-of-word and numeric features extracted from their metadata. A pair of videos is said to have an order on their popularity by comparing their number of views. Video with more viewership is considered to be more popular than the other. Given two videos with their features, the video ranking problem is to construct a model to accurately predict which one has more views.
