\textbf{Ordinal Regression}
Ranking learning or ordinal regression is a learning task of predicting class values possessing a natural order. For example, students' exam paper are often graded in scale of $F < D < C < B < A$. There are several approaches in Machine Learning have been proposed to tackle this problem. 

\begin{itemize}
