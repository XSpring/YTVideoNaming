\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

	\subsection{To-do list}
	There is one additional piece of information that we decided our crawler should collect, which still needs to be added: the number of subscribers for each user.  Since this was not needed for our original proposal, we will need to go back and gather this information, which may take some time considering the vast quantity of videos crawled.

	\subsection{Stretch Goals}
	We certainly hope to attempt increasingly sophisticated learning techniques to reduce our loss as much as possible.  Time allowing, there are also other interesting results we can persue.  Chief among these in our mind is to make more time-dependent predictions.  It may be, for example, that video A is very popular at first, but that video B maintains it's popularity better over time, eventually overtaking video A in terms of the numbers of views and of likes.
