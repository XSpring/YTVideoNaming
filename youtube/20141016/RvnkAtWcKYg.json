When you're clouding up my mind I can't win your losing fight all the time How can I ever own what's mine When you're always taking sides But you won't take away my pride No not this time Not this time How did we get here? Well I used to know you so well How did we get here? Well I think I know The truth is hiding in your eyes And its hanging on your tongue Just boiling in my blood But you think that I can't see What kind of man that you are If you're a man at all Well I will figure this one out On my own I'm screaming, I love you so On my own My thoughts you can't decode How did we get here? Well I used to know you so well, yeah How did we get here? Well I think I know Do you see what we've done? We've gone and made such fools of ourselves Do you see what we've done? We've gone and made such fools of ourselves Yeah How did we get here? Well I used to know you so well, yeah yeah How did we get here? Well I used to know you so well I think I know I think I know Ooh, there is something I see in you It might kill me I want it to be true","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Oct 31, 2008","viewCount":112157556,"noOfLikes":121967,"noOfDislikes":3225,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=RvnkAtWcKYg&list=RDRvnkAtWcKYg","/watch?v=OH9A6tn_P6g","/watch?v=aCyGvGEtOwc","/watch?v=ei8hPkyJ0bU","/watch?v=1kz6hNDlEEg","/watch?v=xN0FFK8JSYE","/watch?v=A63VwWz1ij0","/watch?v=PoTEnaAI9Fo","/watch?v=-J7J_IWUhls","/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU","/watch?v=iDy2wCQYSrU","/watch?v=EFEmTsfFL5A","/watch?v=8yvGCAvOAfM","/watch?v=5anLPw0Efmo","/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY","/watch?v=rtOvBOTyX00","/watch?v=OblL026SvD4","/watch?v=y-MaaxgdUT4","/watch?v=_RrA-R5VHQs","/watch?v=FOjdXSrtUxA","/watch?v=vc6vs-l5dkc","/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU","/watch?v=ykW4rtW2eu0","/watch?v=mgJ8BZi3vTA","/watch?v=i-gyZ35074k","/watch?v=G133kjKy91U","/watch?v=JRfuAukYTKg","/watch?v=t5Sd5c4o9UM","/watch?v=DksSPZTZES0","/watch?v=fV4DiAyExN0","/watch?v=1yw1Tgj9-VU","/watch?v=0G3_kG5FFfQ","/watch?v=gcs5PRxEXq4","/watch?v=ScNNfyq3d_w","/watch?v=LjhCEhWiKXk","/watch?v=jhC1pI76Rqo","/watch?v=iAP9AF6DCu4","/watch?v=gOgpdp3lP8M","/watch?v=RpG7FzXrNSs","/watch?v=r00ikilDxW4"],"category":"Music","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT4M14S","channelID":"UClVrJwcIy7saPcGc1nct80A","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/FueledByRamen","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/105205116970680052945","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
