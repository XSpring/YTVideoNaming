{"key":"qv2nfhH623E","title":"Banned Pokemon Episodes (With Video!)","description":"Nintendo fans, unite!â–ºhttp://tinyurl.com/NintendoFan Want to follow my newest stuff? Follow me at: http://facebook.com/thejwittz http://twitter.com/thejwittz http://wittzgaming.com ***I'm writing this as the video is uploading because I'm inevitably going to get a lot of comments about it. I know the audio is a little laggy during the Japanese Beauty and the Beach segment--it's unfortunate but I just couldn't get a good enough copy working in time. I also think I say \"Beauty and the Beast\" once. Whoops! *I give a warning for inappropriate content because my original card game show brought be a lot of viewers from the Junior division, from ages 10 and under. I'm personally not offended by anything in these videos (I'm pretty anti-censorship myself), I could do without dozens of angry parents thinking I'm a bad example. *Yes, I know the difference between a Dragonair and a Dratini. The episode is about a Dratini, the clip happened to show the Dragonair from the end of the episode. * I say that laser guns and rocket launchers are \"kid friendly\" because they are over-the-top weaponry that is often used to create non-lethal explosions. Physically holding a gun to someone's head is a much scarier image that invokes much more deadly imagery. I am NOT saying that rocket launchers are kid-friendly in real life. *The Meowth/Hitler commentary is more of a joke than an actual suggestion that they made him Hitler. *Not all of these episodes are still banned today. This is just a comprehensive list of all episodes banned for any period of time. I do something a little different today and talk about the banned Anime episodes of Pokemon. It's an exciting bit of Pokemon history that a lot of you might not have ever heard before! I hope you enjoy it, and stay tuned for more fun Fact of the Days each week!","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Sep 15, 2011","viewCount":13312896,"noOfLikes":80834,"noOfDislikes":8265,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=2qe0Xlu9Ta4","/watch?v=hxHrT1moFwc","/watch?v=YJmR-wpjcmQ","/watch?v=_hyqxT0OmYw","/watch?v=Zrvq3wA8FVI","/watch?v=VnwKTQZtQv0","/watch?v=vyY0jRjrTy4","/watch?v=Xs_4A_MyRsc","/watch?v=uiuKWM8nqxw","/watch?v=y-sDbK3pItU","/watch?v=R6DhRwwgZio","/watch?v=1O22uNmZQCk","/watch?v=oetz9scNcVk","/watch?v=UF8gS8HwPAM","/watch?v=HQeedFtYckw","/watch?v=2MeWqbvYpts","/watch?v=Y3bKOzjw9KE&list=PLD66125AED91F97F1","/watch?v=Lh-7kEk1ceE","/watch?v=xdFMKyI1xis","/watch?v=YPid-JSqnsU","/watch?v=nJkuZbDH4pw","/watch?v=UwOzZYtJ5E4","/watch?v=9bn7DGuaMGY","/watch?v=y8WXatrg0q0","/watch?v=mtODX-055g8","/watch?v=sp-E109RM-k","/watch?v=c0hT4aXjPh4","/watch?v=tjEW-leqPfc","/watch?v=uDoMJaNCFw0","/watch?v=ZL3gGode4pA","/watch?v=0Vp4zbQZfDM","/watch?v=KPLCK0KT0YU","/watch?v=GFgfPAcYWT8","/watch?v=OIj-kNkY7Kk","/watch?v=jUMbh2CArdg","/watch?v=LhnRHOYRncc","/watch?v=de3cONeaR_8","/watch?v=ZdTymvjRuoc","/watch?v=X1CvFeraRDE","/watch?v=UHoZRr1dvOo"],"category":"Entertainment","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT16M13S","channelID":"UCUIJFJJLhxIrZVdAVdwL3bQ","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheJWittz","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/112773169108908873121","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
