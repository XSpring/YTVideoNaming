{"key":"ZY78asVr0CI","title":"Ellie Goulding - Wish I Stayed (Acoustic)","description":"lyrics, as requested:) Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on When when men look outside, do they see houses Instead of the fields they grew from We are Constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful Can you get up right now, endeavor to freefall (Off) You can fall if you want to It's just a matter of how far You've treasured our home town But you've forgotten where you are And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found and it has been found wondering around With that skipping rope, the trampoline The crafty smoke that made us choke But we didn't give up hope It's just the simple ways, of getting paid The carelessnes of running away I wish I stayed I wish I stayed I wish I stayed Patterns all aranged in my background It's pillars and posts keeping this country on form Letters were all sent with no addresses So that people can't discover Always undercover Why do i always draw triangles Instead of words this paper so deserves You see I don't own my clothes but i own my mind And it's not what you've lost But it's what you find. I don't own my clothes but i own my mind And it's not what you've lost But it's what you find. With that skipping rope, the trampoline The crafty smoke that made us choke But we didn't give up hope It's just the simple ways, of getting paid The carelessnes of running away I wish I stayed I wish I stayed I wish I stayed cos you can fall if you want to It's just a matter of how far You've treasured our home town But you've forgotten where you are And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found and it has been found wondering around With that skipping rope, the trampoline The crafty smoke that made us choke But we didn't give up hope It's just the simple ways, of getting paid The carelessnes of running away I wish I stayed I wish I stayed I wish I stayed","publishedDate":"Uploaded on May 30, 2010","viewCount":4073739,"noOfLikes":23759,"noOfDislikes":254,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=ZY78asVr0CI&list=RDZY78asVr0CI","/watch?v=miOEmyjpLkU","/watch?v=Z5V0NegnNE8","/watch?v=WFzQ7KAVq1w","/watch?v=TmyimC5sIZY","/watch?v=8BRdY0NR08g","/watch?v=i4kVF77iFrM&list=PL45E8EC41CE391561","/watch?v=D9AFMVMl9qE","/watch?v=i4kVF77iFrM","/watch?v=ThVjiEuDaUs","/watch?v=0NKUpo_xKyQ","/watch?v=Wj6hSDhIB94","/watch?v=yTyL7p0E0Fk","/watch?v=Jp97AWIeMbo","/watch?v=an4ySOlsUMY","/watch?v=8MJio3s2wFI","/watch?v=CGyEd0aKWZE","/watch?v=H-ru2glqXAg","/watch?v=_gMq3hRLDD0","/watch?v=Id7e-9WaxMc","/watch?v=UAMNVNVSPIw","/watch?v=WYSBrtELByQ","/watch?v=o14cRSaTtFA","/watch?v=fBf2v4mLM8k","/watch?v=uESRUaltM90","/watch?v=nkjs0D-V7yM","/watch?v=FOjdXSrtUxA","/watch?v=gRwFRMGpTWg","/watch?v=yRlXausKdiQ","/watch?v=y9ITB0q7NoM","/watch?v=kx5COTBjcNc","/watch?v=Lb2bgUOgY1I","/watch?v=IDwbHeR0UYc","/watch?v=aNzCDt2eidg","/watch?v=IVFGPbQrx24","/watch?v=Sjll7yySgMs","/watch?v=wU_TxQrK370","/watch?v=Zpu_FRuUPIE","/watch?v=JigjU373SKY","/watch?v=xDqQ1kXZPf8"],"category":"Music","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT4M7S","channelID":"UC41NBoyuyyfvUDnriSq_X_g","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/MissNerdfulxD","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/118028481332216248628","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
