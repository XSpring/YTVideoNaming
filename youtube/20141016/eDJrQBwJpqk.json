A challenge to anyone who thinks this is \"bad advice.\" Find a law firm or defense attorney's website that advises you to consent to searches and answer questions. Just post the attorney's name or law firm in your comment. What's in the brown bag?? http://youtu.be/2U1HtqTDDSYÂ  If you post anything suggesting violence against police, your comment will be deleted. If you want to post something thinking you're cute about Super Troopers, you'll be deleted. Before you comment, I suggesting reading AZ v Gant. If you want to tell how the cops in your area are badass and this would never work with them, just save it, it'll be deleted. Flex Your Rights originally produced this video.

IT IS HOW TO REFUSE A SEARCH.** In this video reenactment, some college students are stopped by a police officer. The driver exercises his constitutional rights and goes on about his way. Check out my other videos to see what could have happened if he waived his rights.","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Jun 16, 2008","viewCount":3000840,"noOfLikes":6833,"noOfDislikes":1376,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=KaCe6nQUX5c","/watch?v=s4nQ_mFJV4I","/watch?v=FCZB-k4jKBc","/watch?v=z_ckcdtQ95w","/watch?v=IG7niM9PzeE","/watch?v=s5HJH872QbE","/watch?v=R7b5slUEw4U","/watch?v=dxz9MpgcN5c","/watch?v=RjtDoKDIVIw","/watch?v=4u7lzxjlzmk","/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc","/watch?v=2d7-0TDsxnw","/watch?v=_9RAeRT1-2c","/watch?v=fFyqkMHPOfk","/watch?v=0bg84g8NnnE","/watch?v=gmrbNLt7Om8","/watch?v=gxsFCyGn7sE","/watch?v=wneBHaxvIhU","/watch?v=qWLxPC6YKlA","/watch?v=_2ASPUkkHMs","/watch?v=_2ASPUkkHMs","/watch?v=zdNO10dNqKA","/watch?v=t8LyMwBzpkI","/watch?v=NmyE6_b_xJY","/watch?v=8IPct574o4w","/watch?v=Piowqmm7fZ0","/watch?v=X9k-cblUUR8","/watch?v=8kfoDHYM9yM","/watch?v=ns3Cqsp0Qe8","/watch?v=08fZQWjDVKE","/watch?v=vbSMYuA_fBs","/watch?v=0H_iXI2DkDk","/watch?v=y3znKwYVez4","/watch?v=sLe51DAuF6Q","/watch?v=Hw0r6K4Z-vs","/watch?v=HeyIvq7Z9SA","/watch?v=CON4o98WFXI","/watch?v=jfLwdyMbSHE","/watch?v=jWuE5ug3cLE","/watch?v=yqgYZ_Lp7Ic"],"category":"Education","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT4M33S","channelID":"UCReNDBY9C0_bYnFJ-M7iGDw","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/bart40330","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/110548416375287036345","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
