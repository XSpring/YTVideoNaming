Download it at http://smarturl.it/schoolchildren 'Cupid's Chokehold / Breakfast in America' was written by Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies (Supertramp) LYRICS Take a look at my girlfriend She's the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot It's been some time since we last spoke This is gonna sound like a bad joke But momma I fell in love again It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend And I know it sounds so old But cupid got me in a chokehold And I'm afraid I might give in Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin' I mean she even cooks me pancakes And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches If that ain't love then I don't know what love is We even got a secret handshake And she loves the music that my band makes I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun Take a look at my girlfriend She's the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot It's been awhile since we talked last and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long But I promise this is on a whole new plane I can tell by the way she says my name I love it when she calls my phone She even got her very own ringtone If that ain't love then I don't know what love is It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor She'll be back into my arms once more for sure Take a look at my girlfriend She's the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot She's got a smile that would make the most senile Annoying old man bite his tongue I'm not done She's got eyes comparable to sunrise And it doesn't stop there Man I swear She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten And now she's even got her own song But movin' on She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard And we can be on the phone for three hours Not sayin' one word And I would still cherish every moment And when I start to build my future she's the main component Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here Take a look at my girlfriend She's the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Nov 27, 2006","viewCount":50612472,"noOfLikes":162264,"noOfDislikes":3691,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=eiiU-Fky18s&list=RDeiiU-Fky18s","/watch?v=T3E9Wjbq44E","/watch?v=HrjRj4uQQ1o","/watch?v=ltOR2VzDZFM","/watch?v=bxV-OOIamyk","/watch?v=mqWq_48LxWQ","/watch?v=uxUATkpMQ8A","/watch?v=RSdKmX2BH7o","/watch?v=6NUxMgzHdic","/watch?v=8aRor905cCw","/watch?v=dvf--10EYXw","/watch?v=C6MOKXm8x50","/watch?v=DksSPZTZES0","/watch?v=dWYPtCCYDas","/watch?v=8PTDv_szmL0","/watch?v=ltOR2VzDZFM&list=PLAD27246741ED96E6","/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g","/watch?v=p_RqWocthcc","/watch?v=W-w3WfgpcGg","/watch?v=onzL0EM1pKY","/watch?v=W-w3WfgpcGg","/watch?v=nQJACVmankY","/watch?v=04zaL7wIbmc","/watch?v=yCto3PCn8wo","/watch?v=qQkBeOisNM0","/watch?v=Rmp6zIr5y4U","/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU","/watch?v=HpyZEzrDf4c","/watch?v=y9658xXw9FA","/watch?v=Wa5B22KAkEk","/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg","/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts","/watch?v=OZLUa8JUR18","/watch?v=mk48xRzuNvA","/watch?v=LjhCEhWiKXk","/watch?v=FOjdXSrtUxA","/watch?v=eJO5HU_7_1w","/watch?v=6g6g2mvItp4","/watch?v=fLexgOxsZu0","/watch?v=-J7J_IWUhls"],"category":"Music","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT4M29S","channelID":"UClVrJwcIy7saPcGc1nct80A","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/FueledByRamen","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/105205116970680052945","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AL,AR,AT,AU,BA,BE,BG,BO,BR,CA,CH,CL,CN,CO,CY,CZ,DE,DK,EE,EG,ES,FI,FR,GB,GR,HK,HR,HU,ID,IE,IL,IN,IS,IT,JP,KR,LT,LU,LV,MC,ME,MK,MT,MX,MY,NG,NL,NO,NZ,PE,PG,PH,PL,PT,PY,RO,RS,RU,SE,SG,SI,SK,TH,TR,TW,UA,US,UY,VE,ZA","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
