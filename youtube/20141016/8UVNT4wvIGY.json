But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know I used to know That I used to know Somebody... ************* Video credits: Directed, produced and edited by Natasha Pincus Body art by Emma Hack Cinematographer and colourist: Warwick Field Scenic artist: Howard Clark Key grip: Rob Hansford Assistants: Rose Cidoni, Claire Leighton, Rob Murray Original artwork by Frank De Backer Music credits: Produced by Wally De Backer Mixed by Francois Tetaz, assisted by Wally at Moose Mastering, Richmond, VIC Bass recorded by Wally in Lucas Taranto's loungeroom, Melbourne, VIC All other sounds put together by Wally in The Barn, Merricks, VIC Bass guitar: Lucas Taranto Lead and backing vocals: Kimbra Guitar, flutes, percussion and synth samples, lead and backing vocals: Wally Contains a sample of the recording Seville as performed by Luiz Bonfa.
