{"key":"17rC2kxWu8A","title":"Philippines Poverty","description":"The Arroyo administration's official development agenda focuses specifically on issues of poverty and unemployment. The key document here is the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP), 2001-2004, which stresses poverty reduction through equitable growth, rural development, and social sector investment. The four primary strategies are: 1.Macroeconomic stability and equitable growth, using sound fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation low and avoid surges in unemployment; modernize all sectors through HR development and technology; 2.Comprehensive HR development, basic education, health, shelter, water, electricity; safety nets for most vulnerable sectors; encouraging poor to participate in governance; 3.Modernization of agricultural sector with social equity; agrarian reform, improving rural infrastructure, implementing land reform; 4.Effective governance through transparency, reducing graft and corruption, strengthening partnerships with civil society and the private sector. Poverty is conceptualized broadly, taking into account not only income but its impact in terms of human deprivation, development, and quality of life.","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Apr 30, 2011","viewCount":4936,"noOfLikes":5,"noOfDislikes":2,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=lCZTptEzG98","/watch?v=pnU28fa3ek8","/watch?v=XldM4DtlA-Y","/watch?v=G3QYgRyRbbo","/watch?v=lW6rjhBL3rI","/watch?v=u2cigu5NTAg&list=PL104A2FA7D6069632","/watch?v=SW5qoAKRSKE","/watch?v=X7KBN0HOuiI","/watch?v=eq_umEJIBZc","/watch?v=WA5Vs6M6OXc","/watch?v=vEUfqiBKVSg","/watch?v=zBVee1Z9-Ho","/watch?v=0zKWT_mXiUY","/watch?v=X-H7aJc6TOw","/watch?v=KigXe6RIczw","/watch?v=AzMuAqDVxK8","/watch?v=5fZRlDom6EQ","/watch?v=NwCWXp7CeFY","/watch?v=qjsrdcbbPBU","/watch?v=vlPnF9QE8I8","/watch?v=l_n3OaUCaPs","/watch?v=ON_NQ1HnRYs","/watch?v=lvajj00QyKQ","/watch?v=4uw4sINdHyA","/watch?v=VB4HtHscavw","/watch?v=g-5rxFDXW4E","/watch?v=2zRWngUBaqs","/watch?v=gDZ7P_sZiPg","/watch?v=JHuPK1K3ZJg","/watch?v=h_0IKKJa5JE","/watch?v=MNr4tgTEOMs","/watch?v=SFr5jiWjqiQ","/watch?v=pzrYpmK_ePQ","/watch?v=t0xZH7-HtzQ","/watch?v=ZZT54xk_QAQ","/watch?v=hVyvgQS4Bdc","/watch?v=z3wSso6jpew","/watch?v=4dPPU4Wi1yg","/watch?v=_BVOltSkKlk","/watch?v=IBmy_JE1s2g"],"category":"Education","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT2M29S","channelID":"UCv6tLVGZwzRhDog5CswJlYA","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/eLmAsKArA011","authorGPlusURL":"","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
