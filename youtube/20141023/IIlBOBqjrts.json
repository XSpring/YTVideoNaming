{"key":"IIlBOBqjrts","title":"Ahmed Salah - What Really Happened: (Lessons from the Egyptian Revolution)","description":"Date: 05.09.2012 Notice: The video is cut at some parts, that is because the device I was using was not saving on my memory card, sorry about that. Description: Ahmed Salah, an Egyptian activist, shares his experience and analysis of the Revolution last spring. How did it start? What challenges and obstacles did organizers face and how they were overcome? What has been happening ever since, and what are the current and future possibilities for the revolution in Egypt? How does his experience and analysis tell a story at odds with mainstream representations of the story? Place: UCSC - Charles E.
