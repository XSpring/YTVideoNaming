You fell out of the clear blue sky To the darkness below The smell of your flesh excites me My blood starts to flow So help me god You burst in in a blaze of light You unzippered the dark One kiss took my breath away One look lights up the stars And it's it's one hit to the body It comes straight from the heart One hit to the body Sure went straight to the mark So help me god It's one shot when you love me One shot when you leave me I don't need no security I just need some peace And it's one hit to the body It comes straight from the heart One voice calls out my name It sure went straight to the mark","publishedDate":"Published on Sep 18, 2012","viewCount":481966,"noOfLikes":1863,"noOfDislikes":42,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=dx2WRQLSIew&list=RDdx2WRQLSIew","/watch?v=VQh8oh0rj3s","/watch?v=hic-dnps6MU","/watch?v=hM8XekYI8kI","/watch?v=Te6VBiRjhqA","/watch?v=kC3rQxeal-U","/watch?v=3N0A2b7nbdM","/watch?v=aNX_UCEzu7w","/watch?v=aRYokc3VBC4","/watch?v=hev2qx1y2IU","/watch?v=LVQmSEoO27M","/watch?v=vC0Qt1lvLq8&list=PLFFC0DE5C257B32AF","/watch?v=Schqd6TtbyQ","/watch?v=rLx4xJdCcZ4","/watch?v=yaCYoCAOZbI","/watch?v=fjwIhyMfvRY","/watch?v=ptDz5BwAgXQ","/watch?v=Xrx_55SgwAY","/watch?v=DRot9IjNSso","/watch?v=yropeDbtc0Q","/watch?v=fjwIhyMfvRY","/watch?v=kC3rQxeal-U","/watch?v=3-hMQWqVVzw","/watch?v=LVQmSEoO27M","/watch?v=u6d8eKvegLI","/watch?v=G-mcksb6w2k","/watch?v=TwphTZ8NL5w","/watch?v=6istBsZxABo","/watch?v=1DWiB7ZuLvI","/watch?v=g5W4k6vD2WY","/watch?v=mC57rpO8ChA","/watch?v=1wvIU4EmRJI","/watch?v=KAMwQ0TDnhA","/watch?v=Schqd6TtbyQ","/watch?v=MXNci2yAVu4","/watch?v=U1PyNZJ84LY","/watch?v=6U8JlcB_BzA","/watch?v=RoUa4dIcO50","/watch?v=poXvMBhjSWk","/watch?v=_lNP-x94-SE"],"category":"Music","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT4M26S","channelID":"UCB_Z6rBg3WW3NL4-QimhC2A","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRollingStones","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/117795256301980096827","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
