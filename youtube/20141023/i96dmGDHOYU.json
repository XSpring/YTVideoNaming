{"key":"i96dmGDHOYU","title":"The Geeks Toy + BetAngel Tennis Trader + IBM SlamTracker","description":"Djokovic v Rochus, Wimbledon 2010, 4th set, 10th game, Djokovic serving for the set and struggling. In this extremely boring video, you can see that my version of BetAngel Tennis Trader for The Toy updates the scores (taken from the SlamTracker scoreboard) and odds (taken from The Toy) automatically (it's not the case in the original version of Tennis Trader). Note that having the SlamTracker window open is not neccessary. You can see the Tennis Trader predictions for the next point and after each point you can check if it was accurate. At the end of the video, you can also see that Tennis Trader can determine the starting price of the favorite player. Truth be told, this was a boring game. The next two games in the 5th set were much more interesting as both players broke each others serve (15-40) and the odds moved from 1.4 to 2.4 and seeing Tennis Trader predictions for points in these two games was much more useful than in the game shown in this video.","publishedDate":"Uploaded on Jun 21, 2010","viewCount":11273,"noOfLikes":9,"noOfDislikes":2,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=_Ad11uptznc","/watch?v=4vZe0Og3WNc","/watch?v=mFCdNRPZLQQ","/watch?v=-fV_CIO4CW8","/watch?v=urs-odC-xNc","/watch?v=Q7i1N4jEkXk","/watch?v=YJ42IosEuhg","/watch?v=SUJTc4LX4hw&list=PL3916446C257E4E68","/watch?v=U-gsSz7eLI8","/watch?v=Ko8sYP8igDQ","/watch?v=GDGcpkLEBIg","/watch?v=VUDml5sDiuU","/watch?v=3eY_WfnzAHY","/watch?v=iTucWArRu9Y","/watch?v=6AVq9MHgHIQ","/watch?v=ars-vWN_efI","/watch?v=0uqJ-DdQ6i0","/watch?v=V7KMVU59B6w","/watch?v=cbjgP1toC5c","/watch?v=tfzkJP51-c0","/watch?v=iZkJ9PRabsM","/watch?v=Ha7M9wYa7_k","/watch?v=zDPUZytJG00","/watch?v=Hi_wNYWqgvg","/watch?v=S34Kont01Mw","/watch?v=0uVv6iqEB04","/watch?v=SHcyzgzJPOs","/watch?v=1XjQxKmSTzo","/watch?v=BEGggnZjnNs","/watch?v=Wv_uJYbPRYM","/watch?v=2xoIE7eES9k","/watch?v=reZKisYk0j4","/watch?v=oyxhHkOel2I","/watch?v=342McPSrN6Y","/watch?v=_2bkaWKt718","/watch?v=u2plnVfLr_c","/watch?v=5DdDhEynRFY","/watch?v=lfSMnIGRnVk","/watch?v=LFylDuebP38","/watch?v=2YlRjMfaHlA"],"category":"Science & Technology","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT8M40S","channelID":"UC33OyZuSZhrj7SWChf2iV1w","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/user/catgotyrtongue","authorGPlusURL":"","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
