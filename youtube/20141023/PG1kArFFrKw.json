{"key":"PG1kArFFrKw","title":"Mr. Lif - Head High","description":"From the album \"I Heard It Today (2009)\" Verse 1 So I sit back, relax, pack a bowl Imagine if I made the honor roll hop in if you wanna roll hurry cause I've gotta go jet setter with a vendetta not many men better than the trend setter send weather through your town knockin out your pseudo sound pound through your ground cause tremors dilemmas for antennas and tenor sax players call me Amadeus They say decay, please paint a picture to portray us so I think vividly open up a portal to infinity vision a tank then with my infantry roam through a mine field with thoughts my mind yields the government has offered, yet my men have denied shields so we run in brazen guns blazin' dazing opposition with precision, now we're in position listen, hear that fuse hissin', now your leg is missing blood will glisten, then your soul will seep into the solar system Damn, I started feeling ragged and low, but I could summon up the energy with some of that dro Break me off a leaf and I become the chief I need the relief this world'll never leave me at peace the beast works in many ways many days'll pass he blurs my vision when I stare at my path but yo let me chill God I could rhyme for days on this beat Lemme retreat and smoke a little sticky green leaf Chorus Belief in this plane doesn't seem sane I strain trying to unlock my brain My soul seeks a greater knowledge and so I analyze the globe, and watch the story unfold Living on this plane doesn't seem sane I strain trying to unlock my brain My soul seeks a greater knowledge and so I analyze the globe, and watch the story unfold Verse 2 Man I just sit back and get real blazed start contemplating God's mysterious ways from tribesmen to civilized men to victimized when enslaved to live the ways of colonized men Emancipation onto Nancy Reagan to Michael Irving catching passes from Aikman money don't make men but many look past who they see in the glass to live the ways of modern day and spiritually fast I was living too fast had to slow down create my own sound inspiration leaking through my dome now so foul watching Jeremiah spit fire knowing it reflects on Obama Mo' drama That petty Black shit televised and enacted the perfect trap to turn the \"Change\" campaign backward it hurts that even our most prestigious leaders cannot shun what those centuries of hatred have done That old crabs in a barrel makes our chances none or narrow, to have our race perceived with the graces of a pharaoh It hurts me to the marrow when I drive through the ghetto and see my peoples caught up in a life that won't let go And what's weird is few of them will hear this melody I'm pouring from my heart so fearless but chill God, I could rhyme for days on this beat Lemme retreat, and smoke a little stick green leaf Chorus Belief in this plane doesn't seem sane I strain trying to unlock my brain My soul seeks a greater knowledge and so I analyze the globe, and watch the story unfold Living on this plane doesn't seem sane I strain trying to unlock my brain My soul seeks a greater knowledge and so I analyze the globe, and watch the story unfold","publishedDate":"Published on Mar 6,
