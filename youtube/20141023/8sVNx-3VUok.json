Both sides of this frontier are controlled by the Kurds, who have forged their own path through the country's brutal civil war, between the opposition and the regime. Further south, the fighters of Islamic State (IS) have erased the border between Syria and Iraq, proclaiming their Caliphate. This war is redrawing the map of the region. As IS have carved out their territory, so have the Kurds. The two sides meet at a place called Jezaa, where the rolling hills of the north give way to the flat, dusty plain of the desert. A Kurdish commander points to a small town shimmering on the horizon in the midday heat: it is controlled by IS, he says. There are clashes here almost daily, between IS fighters and the Syrian Kurdish \"People's Protection Units\", also known as \"YPG\".

Diren says that, to the fanatics of IS, a female fighter is \"haram\", anathema: a disturbing and scary sight. \"When they see a woman with a gun, they're so afraid they begin to shake. They portray themselves as tough guys to the world. But when they see us with our guns they run away. They see a woman as just a small thing. But one of our women is worth a hundred of their men.\"","publishedDate":"Published on Sep 14, 2014","viewCount":12242,"noOfLikes":0,"noOfDislikes":0,"relatedURL":["/watch?v=OijrjkXXV-w","/watch?v=VcFTDUNhniI","/watch?v=NTdVGdK1KzY","/watch?v=ZCCODxq8diI","/watch?v=TM_ldLdfBu0","/watch?v=lro62AJ6e7M","/watch?v=Ac_PMMIUvCM","/watch?v=0V7GT9y4Jcw","/watch?v=TGVbpsGmLVo","/watch?v=g-OTe7t0rRc","/watch?v=5xo-5MBTFbA","/watch?v=BEXzLHeDcK8","/watch?v=h_0kg8VlxkE","/watch?v=sea9RxXkOu8","/watch?v=bIK0jAHy9M0","/watch?v=Igj8dqpIcx4","/watch?v=WS3iYUWzHlc","/watch?v=z5bmMSAASXU","/watch?v=0231DDFWv2c","/watch?v=hIWXkhquNz0","/watch?v=0231DDFWv2c","/watch?v=txD2gUWpHu8","/watch?v=Z0wWriPToSQ","/watch?v=zxzz62EDRKM","/watch?v=JUS3jEvoMd8","/watch?v=w62SC7GM0dE","/watch?v=GN0irr3Lc4o","/watch?v=mYYYhRsxP9k","/watch?v=UslgwNNWLBw","/watch?v=7idhjcm4u34","/watch?v=zopK-zDdLlU","/watch?v=AKBtfLFedIY","/watch?v=JIyXc1gHJIU","/watch?v=JJixFm1vCxM","/watch?v=L8EdkH4blIA","/watch?v=_ntcrZ6AQPQ","/watch?v=8cJ9CEfGQ6g","/watch?v=CppxMd7RRgQ","/watch?v=I7a0WlBQ8kw","/watch?v=ZQkq9_UPYbU"],"category":"News & Politics","licence":"Standard YouTube License","comments":[],"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0,"duration":"PT24M25S","channelID":"UC8wCRrYq9pmr1L7Deuwvwpw","authorYTURL":"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wCRrYq9pmr1L7Deuwvwpw","authorGPlusURL":"https://plus.google.com/107670327261843556550","isFamilyFriendly":true,"regionAllowed":"AD,AE,AF,AG,AI,AL,AM,AO,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AW,AX,AZ,BA,BB,BD,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BL,BM,BN,BO,BQ,BR,BS,BT,BV,BW,BY,BZ,CA,CC,CD,CF,CG,CH,CI,CK,CL,CM,CN,CO,CR,CU,CV,CW,CX,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,EH,ER,ES,ET,FI,FJ,FK,FM,FO,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GF,GG,GH,GI,GL,GM,GN,GP,GQ,GR,GS,GT,GU,GW,GY,HK,HM,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IM,IN,IO,IQ,IR,IS,IT,JE,JM,JO,JP,KE,KG,KH,KI,KM,KN,KP,KR,KW,KY,KZ,LA,LB,LC,LI,LK,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,LY,MA,MC,MD,ME,MF,MG,MH,MK,ML,MM,MN,MO,MP,MQ,MR,MS,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NC,NE,NF,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NU,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PF,PG,PH,PK,PL,PM,PN,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RE,RO,RS,RU,RW,SA,SB,SC,SD,SE,SG,SH,SI,SJ,SK,SL,SM,SN,SO,SR,SS,ST,SV,SX,SY,SZ,TC,TD,TF,TG,TH,TJ,TK,TL,TM,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,UG,UM,US,UY,UZ,VA,VC,VE,VG,VI,VN,VU,WF,WS,YE,YT,ZA,ZM,ZW","isPaid":false,"unlisted":false}
