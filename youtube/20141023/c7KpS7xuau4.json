Our video on FAKE Moldavite and how to spot it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4IBV... This stone is truly one of the most powerful stones to bring about change in your life.We talk about how Moldavite effects us when we use it, the effects it may have on you. We also share precautions you should take when using Moldavite and we also give advice on what to look out for when buying Moldavite because of fakes in the market. These videos are offered as a vehicle of personal expression by two Crystalholics who have a LOVE and PASSION for Crystals and living in the Metaphysical side of life. We hope our videos will help alleviate some of the confusion surrounding the countless books and conflicting information on crystals. We want to encourage you to become more intuitive and to explore life through your eyes rather than others. We are NOT experts nor claim to know all the answers we just have a LOVE for our crystal friends :-) Our videos will be covering many things, including, Crystals, Dowsing, Animal healing, Sacred sites, Creating a sacred space, Crystal healing, Crystal and Sound therapy, and much much more. Please SUBSCRIBE and check out our many other videos on our channel and here on YouTube and please drop us a comment as we would LOVE to hear from you, :-) Sending you our Love and Crystal Blessings for your journey ahead :-) Lyn & Sean xxx.
