{"key":"f_kLA168YQ4","title":"Apple iPhone 5s Unboxing!","description":"Apple iPhone 5s Unboxing! Aaron unboxes and does an early review of the Apple iPhone 5s, Apple's newest flagship smartphone. Featuring the new Apple A7 CPU and M7 coprocessor, the iPhone 5s includes new features like a fingerprint scanner for easy access to the phone and iTunes purchases, an improved 8-megapixel camera with 1080p HD recording, iTunes Radio, and of course, iOS 7. It's packing the same overall design, along with the 4-inch Retina Display from the iPhone 5. It's available on Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile in grey, white, and gold. The iPhone 5s offers some nice new features, but in 2013, the iPhone is no longer the undisputed \"best smartphone\" on the market - there are multiple fantastic smartphones out there with features that appeal to everyone. Do improvements in iOS 7, the fingerprint scanner, and revamped camera make it worth buying, or have devices like the HTC One, Samsung Galaxy S 4, and Galaxy Note 3 eclipsed it?
